# Machine-Learning-Project-2023
This repository is a replication work of ASAPNet (https://github.com/tamarott/ASAPNet) and Pix2PixHD (taken from SPADE https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE). The purpose is by replicating the two models to make sure that the result stated in the paper is achievable. Both of this models are trained using cityscapes dataset from scratch with image size of 256x512 and the rest of the requirements are kept the same as mentioned in their paper.
After training both models validation was held and inference time, mean Intersection Over Union, and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is measured.
